# Diamond Price Prediction Project

This project involves predicting the price of diamonds using various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and measurements. The project utilizes machine learning models to analyze a dataset of over 54,000 diamonds and estimate their market value.

## Objectives:
- Develop a model that accurately predicts diamond prices.
- Evaluate the model's performance by comparing predicted prices with actual prices.
- Create a simple application for users to predict diamond prices based on new data.
 
## Methodology:
**1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning:**
    - Load the dataset containing diamond attributes and prices.
    - Cleaning and pre-process the data by handling missing values, outliers, and transformations.
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Analyze the distribution of features and their correlations with the target variable (price).
    - Identify key features that influence diamond prices.
**3. Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Train various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression.
    - Evaluate each model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
    - Choose the model with the best performance for price prediction.
**5. Application Development:**
    - Develop a simple application where users can input diamond attributes and receive predicted prices.
    - Ensure the application is user-friendly and provides meaningful information.

## Results:
- **Model Selection:** Random Forest model was chosen due to its high accuracy and low error rate (MAE of 152.8, representing 3.69% of the mean real price).
- **Profitability Analysis:** The predicted diamond value by the model exceeded the actual price, resulting in a substantial profit of 260,665.12.
- **Simple Application:** A basic application was developed to allow users to predict diamond prices.
  
## Future Enhancements:
- **Error Handling:** Implement checks for valid input formats and ranges for user-input data.
- **Descriptive Output:** Include additional information like price range or confidence intervals for predictions.
- **Visualization:** Add visualizations to showcase relationships between features and their impact on price.
- **Interactive Interface:** Develop a more user-friendly interface for a richer user experience. 

## Conclusion:
This project successfully developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts diamond prices. The model offers potential benefits for diamond sellers by aiding in profit maximization. The project also provides a foundation for further development and enhancements, leading to a more comprehensive and user-friendly diamond price prediction tool.
